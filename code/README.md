# feersum-lid-shared-task
This git repository hosts the data and code that accompanies a paper 'Improved Text Language Identification for the South African Languages'
submitted to Prasa/RobMech 2017 conference.

The paper is on text language identification of short texts of around 15 characters. Hopefully this repo will be useful to create a text language
identification shared task for South African languages.

## The Data
The data is from the NHCLT Text Corpera collected by South African Department of Arts and Culture & Centre for Text Technology (CTexT,
North-West University, South Africa). Each folder in the data contains the original and improved text corpera for a single language.

The corpera is improved from the original version as explained in the paper. The data was cleaned and incorrectly labelled samples were
relabelled.

## The Code
The code hosted here may be used to regenerate the results in the paper. The paper is still under review and the code will be committed here soon.
